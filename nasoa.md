<h3>These are simply all the things that have received the Nic Acton Seal of Approval (or NASoA for short).</h3>
<h2>Professional Development</h2>
<strong><a href="http://bit.do/" target="_blank">URL Shortener (bit.do)</a>: </strong>Allows you to make custom shortened urls and QR codes. Incredibly useful for resumes and business cards!

<strong><a href="https://www.stickermule.com/" target="_blank">Sticker Mule</a>:</strong>
Sticker Mule provides an excellent platform for custom stickers for your Macbook, your wall, even your floor! Click the image below for $10 credit, which is more than enough for a set of 10 custom stickers for $9!

<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<strong><a href="https://quip.com" target="_blank">Quip</a>:</strong> One of the the best environments for collaborating on and creating beautiful, simple, well-designed documents online. Includes a great interface for making comments and task-management between team members.

<strong><a href="http://drive.google.com" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>: </strong>The obvious one. Store documents and files and collaborate on them in real-time. Only downsides are that group members must have Google accounts and there are some problems that might occur when exporting to different document types, such as a Word Document, if your professor/employer prefers viewing them that way.

<strong><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>: </strong>A little complex to get started, but one of the best ways to maintain version control on large projects, whether it's for coding or large documents. Keeps records of all changes so that you can rollback to old versions and track changes easily.
<h2>Making Life Easier</h2>
<strong><a href="https://getpocket.com" target="_blank">Pocket</a></strong>: The best save-for-later service I've ever used, and I've used quite a few. You can, and should, use tags to help organize your saved webpages for later consumption or reference. If you save something like an article, it will scrape the important information and images from it so you don't need to go to the whole article to read it.

<strong><a href="https://www.mindmeister.com/" target="_blank">Mindmeister</a></strong>: An online mapping tool that allows you to map out diagrams made of simple items and then expand on each item in encapsulated notes, links, and images. Very useful for mapping out major decisions such as where to go to school or choosing between places to move to. Also has many tools that allow for easy collaboration between other users!

<strong><a href="http://fakespot.com/" target="_blank">Fakespot</a></strong>: As a Systems Engineer, I love combining cheap/low-power products from Amazon to make amazing systems. That being said, sometimes products that are highly rated are buffed up by fake reviews from the manufacturer! Put the Amazon link into this site and it will run a complex algorithm comparing all the reviewers to determine if the current reviews are legitimate. Shop smarter!
<h2>Education</h2>
<strong><a href="https://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank">Lynda.com</a></strong>: Thousands of professional-grade lecture and tutorial videos. Very good for familiarizing yourself with software packages like Adobe creative software or getting started on different programming languages and environments. While it is not a free commercial service, some universities and public libraries offer it to their students/locals.

<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/crysknife007" target="_blank">Ambient Sci-Fi Ships</a></strong>: This youtube channel has a large collection of ambient ship sounds. Study like Captain Kirk or Picard while listening to the slow hum of the starship Enterprise. Drowns out other distracting noises and allows you to focus on your work. Also good white noise for sleeping (so be careful not to study when you're tired!)
