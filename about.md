### Who Am I?
I am a 20-something Systems/Computer Engineer who is always learning new things.

General public can use my page for interesting tips and tricks to help their computer/physical productivity.

Tech/Engineering beginners can use it to help guide themselves towards a career in systems/software/computer/gadget development and learn from my mistakes.

Employers, small start-ups & potential research partners can use it to browse my work and determine if I'm what they're looking for.

I also talk about generally-tame subjects with a light/humorous tone.
