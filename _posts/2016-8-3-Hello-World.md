After a short stint on Wordpress (nicacton.com), I've discovered the wonderful world of Github page hosting! I will be moving my blog posts to this Jekyll blog. It will be a little harder to keep up with my posts without the ability to "follow" my blog but I will be sure to include an RSS. Look forward to much more detailed posts!
